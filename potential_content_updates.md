Based on the provided transcripts and documents, here are several key updates and content strategies for your website to improve marketing and sales:

1. Refined Value Proposition (The "Context" Advantage)
As you requested, you should emphasize that generic AI tools (like a standard ChatGPT prompt) are built for everyone and therefore provide generic results.

Key Messaging: "Daita Dynamics helps you maximize AI potential by building your business’s full context—your proprietary data, frameworks, and philosophy—into your systems."
The Competitive Edge: Highlight that while others get generic answers, your clients get a "competitive advantage" because the AI is trained on their specific "brain" and IP (Source 6).
2. Highlight the "AI Opportunity Assessment" (Entry Offer)
According to the Daita Dynamics Vision Meeting (Source 4), this is your primary "foot in the door" offer.

Content: Explicitly list the AI Opportunity Assessment as the starting point for businesses that "don't know where to start."
Pricing/Value: Position it as an affordable way ($1,000–$4,000) to get a clear Roadmap for implementation (Source 4).
3. Showcase "Structured Intelligence" Portals
Instead of just saying you build AI, show how you turn "unstructured data" into "structured beauty."

Visual Content: Use the example of the podcast portal or the "deliverable maker" (Source 7). Explain that you take raw transcripts and "messy" data and turn them into structured JSON frameworks that power beautiful, consistent interfaces (Source 1, 7).
4. Use Industry-Specific Use Cases
Source 2 (Prep for L10 CFO Call) provides a goldmine of specific examples you should list on a "Solutions" or "Services" page:

Operations: Internal chatbots trained on company processes to answer employee questions (Source 2).
Sales/Lead Gen: Automating the scraping, researching, and qualifying of leads (Source 2).
Recruiting: AI systems that research hundreds of LinkedIn profiles at once or turn a candidate database into a searchable knowledge base (Source 2).
5. The "Philosophy Integration" Feature
Highlight your ability to "bake" a leader’s specific philosophy into the AI.

Insight: Mention that your systems don't just process data; they adopt the "language and dots" of the business owner, making the AI's output look and feel like it came from the CEO or a senior expert (Source 9, 10).
6. Technical Implementation (The JSON Framework)
According to your conversation with Pop (Source 1), you should mention your methodology for building website content and user profiles.

Advice: Use a JSON framework to ensure that every profile (whether for a team member or a client) is structured identically. This ensures the website remains "helpful" and "structured" rather than just a wall of text (Source 1, 3).
7. Target Audience Alignment
Your website copy should speak directly to the pain points of your target market: CEOs and business owners of companies with 10–200 employees (Source 2).

Focus on: Scaling, building systems, and moving from "overwhelmed" to "focused" (Source 2, 5).
